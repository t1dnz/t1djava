# t1d.java

This library models and implements algorithms related to Type 1 Diabetes in the kotlin language for android use.

# Goals

I am attempting to create a common set of test cases to verify this implementation against in t1d.tests project. That is so I can reimplement in other languages t1d.js and t1d.swift. The ultimiate goal is to have the same set of tools using the same models to use across different platforms like frontend web, backend web, iOS and Android.
